A very simple image classifier using resnet18 to detect what was the Persian food you had at that restaurant. The web application is available here (built in Streamlit): 
https://share.streamlit.io/donyazz/persian-food-image-classifier/main/PersianFood_ImageClassifier.py

This project is based on fastai course and uses fastai and pytorch deep learning libraries. 

The files in this repository are as follow:
  1.  PersianFood_ImageClassifier.py: this is the deployment file
  2.  export.pkl: this is the model
  3.  requirements.txt: this is the list of requirements
  4.  PersianFood_ImageClassifier_model_training.ipnyb: this is the main file in Jupyter notebook, containing how the dataset is made, how the model istrained, etc.

The images are taken from Bing (in the 'PersianFood_ImageClassifier_model_training.ipnyb'). Data cleaning is done by fastai GUI for this purpose.
